Rose: It was helpful to learn about codespace in Github. It looks like a great option in the future, specially when I migrate out of the UofA and HPC.

Bud: I would like to deepen my knowdledge on cding in batch and how this can be an alternative to coding on python, R, etc.

Thorn: This was a good introduction to bash and codespace. Really useful topics.
