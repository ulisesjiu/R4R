Rose:
It was really cool to get to know how to create a website without having to know html. 
Naviely I thought creating a website required highly technical skills or using a plataform that made it easy but took away most of the creative part.
Markdown makes it really cool to design customized websites without highly technical skills as required using html. 

Bud:
I would like to use the topics learned on class to design my own website.

Thorn:
I think Michele made an awesome work explaining the topics. Great work!
