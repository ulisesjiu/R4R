Rose: Great passing through hpc by Michele. I have worked with hpc in the past so most of it was a reminder of best practices while working with hpc.

Bud: I'm already using hpc on my research

Thorn: I think Michele made an awesome work explaining the topics. Also most of the stuf he went through I had to tach it by myself. 
I would have loved it if I had taken this course when I first joined UofA.
